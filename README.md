## 📦 What's Inside

<img src="docs/img/ide-screenshot.png" alt="IDE Screenshot" width="600">

### 📋 Flexible Development Workflows via Slash Commands

**Quick Development** (For fast fixes, refactoring, experiments):
- `/quick` - Fast, focused development without spec-driven overhead → No mandatory TDD (Sonnet 4.5)

**Spec-Driven Workflow** (For complex features requiring planning and testing):
- `/plan` - Based on your input asks the right questions → Detailed spec with exact code (Opus 4.1)
- `/implement` - Execute spec with mandatory TDD → Auto-manages context when full (Sonnet 4.5)
- `/remember` - Stores learnings in cross-session memory → Continue after /clear (Sonnet 4.5)
- `/verify` - End-to-end spec verification → All tests, quality, security (Sonnet 4.5)

### 💡 Modular Rules System with Auto-Generated Commands & Skills
- **Rules Builder** - Automatically assembles commands and skills from markdown rules on every `cc` startup
- **Core Rules** - Coding standards, TDD enforcement, error handling, validation, context management
- **Extended Rules** - Domain-specific rules auto-converted to skills, f. ex. @frontend-components
- **Workflow Rules** - Command-specific behavior for /plan, /implement, /verify, /quick, /remember
- **Flexible Customization** - Edit `.claude/rules/config.yaml` to adjust which rules apply to which commands

### 🔌 Enhanced Context and Capabilities via MCP Servers
- **Cipher & Claude Context** - Cross-session memory and semantic code search for optimal context
- **Context7 & Ref** - Up-to-date library documentation with limited context blur
- **FireCrawl** - Web scraping and search for dynamic data retrieval in MarkDown format
- **MCP Funnel** - Allows to plug-in more MCP servers as needed without wasting context

### 🛠️ Testing and Quality via Automated Tool Installation
- **Post-Edit Hooks** - Automated formatting and code checking after every edit
- **Qlty** - Automated code quality hooks for all programming languages
- **uv, ruff, mypy, basedpyright** - Python linter, formatter, and type checker (optional)
- **Newman** - API end-to-end testing with Postman collections

### 🏗️ One-Command Installation
- **Automated Setup Script** - Installs and configures everything in one command
- **Global Tools** - Python tools, qlty, Claude Code, Cipher, Newman installed globally
- **Shell Integration** - Auto-configures bash, zsh, and fish with `cc` alias
- **IDE Compatible** - Works with VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or any terminal

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📥 Installation

Run this one-liner in any existing project directory that you want to enable Claude CodePro in:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxritter/claude-codepro/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

It will automatically install all dependencies and ask you a few setup questions.

---

## 📒 How-to-use

### ⚙️ Configuration

1. Open Claude Code in the IDE Terminal, Extension or an external Terminal with the `cc` command

2. In CC, run `/config` to set `Auto-connect to IDE=true` and set `Auto-compact=false` for best experience
<img src="docs/img/ide-setup-config.png" alt="Setup config Screenshot" width="600">

3. In CC, run `/ide` to connect to VS Code diagnostics and make sure all MCP servers for `/mcp` are online

4. In CC, run `/context` to verify context looks similar to this screenshot with less than 20% used

### 👣 First Steps

**For Quick Changes:**
- Use `/quick` - Fast development for fixes, refactoring, or experiments without spec overhead
- TDD not enforced, but best practices still apply via core rules and auto-injected skills

**For Complex Features (Spec-Driven & TDD):**
- Start with `/plan` - Provide your input and it will ask clarifying questions to create a spec
- Use `/implement` to execute the spec with automatic TDD, best practices and context management
- When context fills, `/remember` automatically updates your plan and stores learnings
- After spec completion, run `/verify` to run end-to-end review, all tests, and quality checks

### 🎯 Rules Builder
The system uses a modular rules-based architecture that automatically generates slash commands and skills:

- `.claude/rules/core/` - Fundamental rules injected into all commands
- `.claude/rules/workflow/` - Command-specific behavior (plan.md, implement.md, verify.md, quick.md, remember.md)
- `.claude/rules/extended/` - Domain-specific rules auto-converted to individual skills
- `.claude/rules/config.yaml` - Defines which rules are included in which commands

**Auto-Rebuild:** Commands and skills are automatically regenerated on every `cc` startup, making customization seamless.

## ⚖️ What Makes This Different

**Compared to Other Spec-Driven Frameworks (SpecKit, AgentOS, OpenSpec):**

- 📦 **One-Line Installation** - No containers, no complex setup, just one curl command
- 🤓 **Language Agnostic** - Works with Python, Node.js, Go, Rust, or any language
- 💾 **Persistent Memory** - Cross-session memory maintains knowledge between resets
- ⚡ **Token-Optimized** - No tokens wasted during too complex planning, just works
- ✅ **Production-Grade** - Actively used in client and enterprise projects
- 📝 **Enforced TDD** - Code written before tests gets deleted automatically
- 💯 **Real Verification** - Must show actual outputs based on tests, not assumptions
- 🛠️ **Complete Ecosystem** - Skills, MCP servers, testing tools are integrated and configured

---

## 👥 Who This Is For

- **Professional Developers** - Shipping to production with quality standards
- **Solo Builders** - Managing complex features without losing context
- **Engineering Teams** - Ensuring consistent TDD and code quality
- **Frustrated Coders** - Tired of half-tested, "should work" implementations
