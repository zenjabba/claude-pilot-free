## ⚡ What's Inside

**Claude CodePro is token-optimized and built using latest techniques such as the new skills feature:**

### 📋 Token-Optimized Spec-Driven Workflow via Slash Commands
- `/plan` - Based on your input asks the right questions → Detailed spec with exact code (Opus 4.1)
- `/implement` - Execute spec with mandatory TDD → Auto-manages context when full (Sonnet 4.5)
- `/remember` - Stores learnings in cross-session memory → Continue after /clear (Sonnet 4.5)
- `/verify` - E2E spec verification → All tests, data integrity, quality checks (Sonnet 4.5)

### 🎨 Auto-Enforce Best Practices and Standards via Skills
- **Testing Skills** - TDD, test writing, anti-patterns, debugging, verification, code review
- **Global Skills** - Coding style, commenting, conventions, error handling, validation
- **Backend Skills** - API design, models, queries, migrations
- **Frontend Skills** - Components, CSS, accessibility, responsive design

### 🔌 Enhanced Context and Capabilities via MCP Servers
- **Cipher** - Cross-session memory so context is never lost between /clear commands
- **Claude Context** - Semantic codebase search for optimal context retrieval
- **Context7 & Ref** - Up-to-date library documentation with limited context blur
- **DBHub & FireCrawl** - Database access and web scraping for dynamic data retrieval
- **MCP Funnel** - Allows to plug-in more MCP servers as needed without wasting context

### 🛠️ Testing and Quality via Automated Tool Installation
- **uv/pytest** - Unit and integration testing with uv
- **Newman** - API end-to-end testing with Postman collections
- **Qlty** - Automated code quality hooks
- **Basedpyright** - Type checking with enhanced features
- **Ruff** - Fast Python linter and formatter

### 🐳 Automated Dev Container Setup (VS Code / Cursor / Windsurf)
- **Integrated Features** - Zsh, Node.js, Docker-in-Docker, uv, ruff, basedpyright, git, fzf
- **IDE Extensions** - Python, Docker, SQL, testing, formatting, and development tools
- **CLI Tools** - qlty, Claude Code, Statusline, dotenvx, Cipher, Newman
- **Local Database** - Local PostgreSQL instance on port 5433 for development and testing

## 🎯 What Makes This Different

### Compared to Other Spec-Driven Frameworks (OpenSpec, SpecKit, AgentOS):

- 💾 **Persistent Memory** - Cross-session memory maintains knowledge between resets
- ⚡ **Token-Optimized** - No tokens wasted during too complex planning, just works
- ✅ **Production-Grade** - Actively used in client and enterprise projects
- 📝 **Enforced TDD** - Code written before tests gets deleted automatically
- 💯 **Real Verification** - Must show actual outputs based on tests, not assumptions
- 🛠️ **Complete Ecosystem** - Skills, MCP servers, testing tools are integrated and configured
- 📦 **Works Immediately** - Pre-configured automated setup with everything you need

---

## 👥 Who This Is For

- **Professional Developers** - Shipping to production with quality standards
- **Solo Builders** - Managing complex features without losing context
- **Engineering Teams** - Ensuring consistent TDD and code quality
- **Frustrated Coders** - Tired of half-tested, "should work" implementations

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Supports **all operating systems** (Windows / macOS / Linux) and **ARM/x86 architectures**
- **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)** or **[OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/download)**
- **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** or **[Cursor](https://cursor.com/)** or **[Windsurf](https://windsurf.dev/)**
- **[Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)**
- **Optional**: **[Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)** for the best terminal experience

### 📥 Installation

- Clone this repository and install the prerequisites from above
- Open folder in VS Code, click on the button on the bottom-left: `Reopen in Container`
- Wait for automatic build to finish, this can take a couple of minutes
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your credentials and API keys
- Restart the container via Command Palette: `Developer: Reload Window`

### ⚙️ Configuration

- In the launched terminal, run `cc` and finish the Claude Code Container setup
- Run `/config` to set auto-connect to IDE to true and disable auto-compaction, enable verbose output
- Run `/ide` to connect to VS Code diagnostics and make sure all MCP servers for `/mcp` are online
- You can click `USAGE` in the lower bar to start a split terminal and monitor usage with `/usage`
- Open Claude Code in the IDE Terminal, Extension or an external Terminal like Warp with the `cc` command

### 👣 First Steps

- Start with `/plan` - Provide your input and it will ask clarifying questions to create a spec
- Use `/implement` to execute the spec with automatic TDD, best practices and context management
- When context fills, `/remember` automatically updates your plan and stores learnings
- After spec completion, run `/verify` to ensure all changes are working and tests pass
- Watch as CC automatically applies best practices, testing, and quality control with every step
