## Why I Built This

I'm a senior IT freelancer from Germany. My clients hire me to ship production-quality code — tested, typed, formatted, and reviewed. When something goes into production under my name, quality isn't optional.

Claude Code writes code fast. But without structure, it skips tests, loses context, and produces inconsistent results. I tried other frameworks — they burned tokens on bloated prompts without adding real value. Some added process without enforcement. Others were prompt templates that Claude ignored when context got tight. None made Claude reliably produce production-grade code.

So I built Pilot. Instead of adding process on top, it bakes quality into every interaction. Linting, formatting, and type checking run as enforced hooks on every edit. TDD is mandatory, not suggested. Context is monitored and preserved across sessions. Every piece of work goes through verification before it's marked done.

---

## Before & After

| Without Pilot              | With Pilot                                                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Writes code, skips tests   | TDD enforced — RED, GREEN, REFACTOR on every feature            |
| No quality checks          | Hooks auto-lint, format, type-check on every file edit          |
| Context degrades mid-task  | Endless Mode with automatic session handoff                     |
| Every session starts fresh | Persistent memory across sessions via Pilot Console             |
| Hope it works              | Verifier sub-agents perform code review before marking complete |
| No codebase knowledge      | Production-tested rules loaded into every session               |
| Generic suggestions        | Coding standards activated conditionally by file type           |
| Changes mixed into branch  | Isolated worktrees — review and squash merge when verified      |
| Manual tool setup          | MCP servers + language servers pre-configured and ready         |

## Why This Approach Works

There are other AI coding frameworks out there. I tried them. They add complexity — dozens of agents, elaborate scaffolding, thousands of lines of instruction files — but the output doesn't improve proportionally. More machinery burns more tokens, increases latency, and creates more failure modes. Complexity is not a feature.

**Pilot optimizes for output quality, not system complexity.** The rules are minimal and focused. There's no big learning curve, no project scaffolding to set up, no state files to manage. You install it, run `pilot`, and the quality guardrails are just there — hooks, TDD, type checking, formatting — enforced automatically on every edit, in every session.

This isn't a vibe coding tool. It's built for developers who ship to production and need code that actually works. Every rule in the system comes from daily professional use: real bugs caught, real regressions prevented, real sessions where the AI cut corners and the hooks stopped it. The rules are continuously refined based on what measurably improves output.

The system stays fast because it stays simple. Quick mode is direct execution with zero overhead — no sub-agents, no plan files, no directory scaffolding. You describe the task and it gets done. `/spec` adds structure only when you need it: plan verification, TDD enforcement, independent code review, automated quality checks. Both modes share the same quality hooks. Both modes hand off cleanly across sessions with Endless Mode.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Claude Subscription:** [Max](https://claude.com/pricing), [Team Premium](https://claude.com/pricing#team-&-enterprise), or [Enterprise](https://claude.com/pricing#team-&-enterprise) recommended; using the API may lead to much higher costs

### Installation

`cd` into your project folder, then run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxritter/claude-pilot/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Choose your environment:**

- **Local Installation** — Install directly on your system using Homebrew. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL2).
- **Dev Container** — Pre-configured, isolated environment with all tools ready. No system conflicts and works on any OS.

After installation, run `pilot` or `ccp` in your project folder to start Claude Pilot.

<details>
<summary><b>What the installer does</b></summary>

8-step installer with progress tracking, rollback on failure, and idempotent re-runs:

1. **Prerequisites** — Checks Homebrew, Node.js, Python 3.12+, uv, git
2. **Dependencies** — Installs Vexor, playwright-cli, mcp-cli, Claude Code
3. **Shell integration** — Auto-configures bash, fish, and zsh with `pilot` alias
4. **Config & Claude files** — Sets up `.claude/` plugin, rules, commands, hooks, MCP servers
5. **VS Code extensions** — Installs recommended extensions for your stack
6. **Dev Container** — Auto-setup with all tools pre-configured
7. **Automated updater** — Checks for updates on launch with release notes and one-key upgrade
8. **Cross-platform** — macOS, Linux, Windows (WSL2)

</details>

### Installing a Specific Version

If the current version has issues, you can install a specific stable version (see [releases](https://github.com/maxritter/claude-pilot/releases)):

```bash
export VERSION=6.4.0
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxritter/claude-pilot/main/install.sh | bash
```

## How It Works

### /sync — Sync Rules & Standards

Run `/sync` to sync rules and standards with your codebase. Explores your codebase, builds a semantic search index, discovers undocumented patterns, updates project documentation, and creates new custom skills. Run it once initially, then anytime again:

```bash
pilot
> /sync
```

<details>
<summary><b>What <code>/sync</code> does in detail</b></summary>

| Phase | Action                                                          |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Load reference guidelines, output locations, error handling     |
| 1     | Read existing rules and standards from `.claude/`               |
| 2     | Build Vexor semantic search index (first run may take 5-15 min) |
| 3     | Explore codebase with Vexor/Grep to find patterns               |
| 4     | Compare discovered vs documented patterns                       |
| 5     | Sync/update `project.md` with tech stack and commands           |
| 6     | Sync MCP server documentation                                   |
| 7     | Update existing custom skills that have changed                 |
| 8     | Discover and document new undocumented patterns as rules        |
| 9     | Create new skills via `/learn` command                          |
| 10    | Report summary of all changes                                   |

</details>

### /spec — Spec-Driven Development

Best for complex features, refactoring, or when you want to review a plan before implementation:

```bash
pilot
> /spec "Add user authentication with OAuth and JWT tokens"
```

```
Discuss  →  Plan  →  Approve  →  Implement  →  Verify  →  Done
                                     │              ↑       ↓
                                     │              └─ Loop─┘
                                     ▼
                                  Task 1 (TDD)
                                     ▼
                                  Task 2 (TDD)
                                     ▼
                                  Task 3 (TDD)
```

<details>
<summary><b>Plan Phase</b></summary>

1. Explores entire codebase with semantic search (Vexor)
2. Asks clarifying questions before committing to a design
3. Writes detailed spec to `docs/plans/` as reviewed markdown with scope, tasks, and definition of done
4. **Plan-verifier sub-agent** independently validates completeness and alignment with your request
5. Auto-fixes any issues found by the verifier
6. Waits for your approval — you can edit the plan first

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Implement Phase</b></summary>

1. Creates an isolated git worktree on a dedicated branch — main branch stays clean
2. Implements each task sequentially with strict TDD (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
3. Quality hooks auto-lint, format, and type-check every file edit
4. Runs full test suite after each task to catch regressions early
5. All tasks execute in the main context with full access to hooks and rules

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Verify Phase</b></summary>

1. Runs full test suite — unit, integration, and E2E
2. Type checking and linting across the entire project
3. Executes actual program to verify real-world behavior (not just tests)
4. **Spec-verifier sub-agent** performs independent code review against the plan
5. Auto-fixes all findings, then re-verifies until clean
6. Loops back to implementation if structural issues remain
7. On success, shows diff summary and offers to squash merge worktree back to main branch

</details>

### Smart Model Routing

Pilot uses the right model for each phase — Opus where reasoning quality matters most, Sonnet where speed and cost matter:

| Phase                 | Model  | Why                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planning**          | Opus   | Exploring your codebase, designing architecture, and writing the spec requires deep reasoning. A good plan is the foundation of everything.       |
| **Plan Verification** | Opus   | Catching gaps, missing edge cases, and requirement mismatches before implementation saves expensive rework.                                       |
| **Implementation**    | Sonnet | With a solid plan, writing code is straightforward. Sonnet is fast, cost-effective, and produces high-quality code when guided by a clear spec.   |
| **Code Verification** | Opus   | Independent code review against the plan requires the same reasoning depth as planning — catching subtle bugs, logic errors, and spec deviations. |

**The insight:** Implementation is the easy part when the plan is good and verification is thorough. Pilot invests reasoning power where it has the highest impact — planning and verification — and uses fast execution where a clear spec makes quality predictable.

### Quick Mode

Just chat. No plan file, no approval gate. All quality hooks and TDD enforcement still apply.

```bash
pilot
> Fix the null pointer bug in user.py
```

### /learn — Online Learning

Capture non-obvious discoveries as reusable skills. Triggered automatically after 10+ minute investigations, or manually:

```bash
pilot
> /learn "Extract the debugging workflow we used for the race condition"
```

### /vault — Team Vault

Share rules, commands, and skills across your team via a private Git repository:

```bash
pilot
> /vault
```

- **Private** — Use any Git repo (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket — public or private)
- **Pull** — Install shared assets from your team's vault
- **Push** — Share your custom rules and skills with teammates
- **Version** — Assets are versioned automatically (v1, v2, v3...)

### Pilot CLI

The `pilot` binary (`~/.pilot/bin/pilot`) manages sessions, worktrees, licensing, and context. Run `pilot` or `ccp` with no arguments to start Claude with Endless Mode.

<details>
<summary><b>Session & Context</b></summary>

| Command                               | Purpose                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pilot`                               | Start Claude with Endless Mode, auto-update, and license check   |
| `pilot run [args...]`                 | Same as above, with optional flags (e.g., `--skip-update-check`) |
| `pilot check-context --json`          | Get current context usage percentage                             |
| `pilot send-clear <plan.md>`          | Trigger Endless Mode continuation with plan context              |
| `pilot send-clear --general`          | Trigger continuation without a plan                              |
| `pilot register-plan <path> <status>` | Associate a plan file with the current session                   |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Worktree Isolation</b></summary>

| Command                                | Purpose                                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `pilot worktree create --json <slug>`  | Create isolated git worktree for safe experimentation |
| `pilot worktree detect --json <slug>`  | Check if a worktree already exists                    |
| `pilot worktree diff --json <slug>`    | List changed files in the worktree                    |
| `pilot worktree sync --json <slug>`    | Squash merge worktree changes back to base branch     |
| `pilot worktree cleanup --json <slug>` | Remove worktree and branch when done                  |
| `pilot worktree status --json`         | Show active worktree info for current session         |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>License & Auth</b></summary>

| Command                        | Purpose                                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `pilot activate <key>`         | Activate a license key on this machine |
| `pilot deactivate`             | Deactivate license on this machine     |
| `pilot status [--json]`        | Show current license status            |
| `pilot verify [--json]`        | Verify license (used by hooks)         |
| `pilot trial --check [--json]` | Check trial eligibility                |
| `pilot trial --start [--json]` | Start a trial                          |

</details>

All commands support `--json` for structured output. Multiple Pilot sessions can run in parallel on the same project — each session tracks its own worktree and context state independently.

### Rules, Commands & Skills

Create your own in your project's `.claude/` folder:

| Type         | Loaded                                          | Best for                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Rules**    | Every session, or conditionally by file type    | Guidelines Claude should always follow   |
| **Commands** | On demand via `/command`                        | Specific workflows or multi-step tasks   |
| **Skills**   | On demand, created via `/learn`                 | Reusable knowledge from past sessions    |

Claude Pilot automatically installs best-practice rules, commands, and coding standards. Standards rules use `paths` frontmatter to activate only when you're working with matching file types (e.g., Python standards load only when editing `.py` files). Custom skills are created by `/learn` when it detects non-obvious discoveries, workarounds, or reusable workflows — and can be shared across your team via `/vault`.

### Custom MCP Servers

Add your own MCP servers in two locations:

| Config File        | How It Works                                         | Best For                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `.mcp.json`        | Instructions load into context when triggered        | Lightweight servers (few tools) |
| `mcp_servers.json` | Called via mcp-cli; instructions never enter context | Heavy servers (many tools)      |

Run `/sync` after adding servers to generate documentation.

## Under the Hood

### The Hooks Pipeline

**Hooks** fire automatically at every stage of development:

#### SessionStart (on startup, clear, or compact)

| Hook            | Type     | What it does                                       |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Memory loader   | Blocking | Loads persistent context from Pilot Console memory |
| Session tracker | Async    | Initializes user message tracking for the session  |

#### PostToolUse (after every Write / Edit / MultiEdit)

After **every single file edit**, these hooks fire:

| Hook                 | Type         | What it does                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `file_checker.py`    | Blocking     | Dispatches to language-specific checkers: Python (ruff + basedpyright), TypeScript (Prettier + ESLint + tsc), Go (gofmt + golangci-lint). Auto-fixes formatting.     |
| `tdd_enforcer.py`    | Non-blocking | Checks if implementation files were modified without failing tests first. Shows reminder to write tests. Excludes test files, docs, config, TSX, and infrastructure. |
| Memory observer      | Async        | Captures development observations to persistent memory.                                                                                                              |
| `context_monitor.py` | Non-blocking | Monitors context window usage. Warns as usage grows, forces handoff before hitting limits. Caches for 15 seconds to avoid spam.                                      |

#### PreToolUse (before search, web, or task tools)

| Hook               | Type     | What it does                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tool_redirect.py` | Blocking | Routes WebSearch, WebFetch, Grep, Task, and plan mode tools to appropriate contexts. Prevents tools from being accidentally lost during plan/implement phases. |

#### Stop (when Claude tries to finish)

| Hook                 | Type     | What it does                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `spec_stop_guard.py` | Blocking | If an active spec exists with PENDING or COMPLETE status, **blocks stopping**. Forces verification to complete before the session can end. |
| Session summarizer   | Async    | Saves session observations to persistent memory for future sessions.                                                                       |

### Endless Mode

The context monitor tracks usage in real-time and manages multi-session continuity:

- As context grows, Pilot warns, then forces a handoff before hitting limits
- Session state is saved to `~/.pilot/sessions/` with continuation files — picks up seamlessly in the next session
- During `/spec`, Pilot won't start a new phase when context is high — it hands off instead
- Multiple Pilot sessions can run in parallel on the same project without interference
- Status line shows live context usage, memory status, active plan, and license info

### Built-in Rules

Production-tested best practices loaded into **every session**. These aren't suggestions — they're enforced standards.

</details>

### Built-in Coding Standards

Conditional rules activated by file type — loaded only when working with matching files:

| Standard             | Activates On                    | Coverage                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |

## What Users Say

<!-- Replace with real testimonials from GitHub issues, discussions, or direct feedback as they come in -->

> "I stopped reviewing every line Claude writes. The hooks catch formatting and type errors automatically, TDD catches logic errors, and the spec verifier catches everything else. I review the plan, approve it, and the output is production-ready."

> "Other frameworks I tried added so much overhead that half my tokens went to the system itself. Pilot is lean — quick mode has zero scaffolding, and even /spec only adds structure where it matters. More of my context goes to actual work."

> "Endless Mode solved the problem I didn't know how to fix. Complex refactors used to stall at 60% because Claude lost track of what it was doing. Now it hands off cleanly and the next session picks up exactly where the last one stopped."

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Does Pilot send my code or data to external services?</b></summary>

No. All development data stays on your machine. Vector search (Vexor), embeddings, persistent memory (Pilot Console), and session state all run locally. Pilot does not operate any cloud backend or telemetry service. The only external communication is between Claude Code and Anthropic's API — using your own subscription or API key, exactly as it would without Pilot.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is Pilot enterprise-compliant for data privacy?</b></summary>

Yes. Since Pilot runs entirely locally and adds no additional external data flows beyond what Claude Code itself uses, it is compatible with enterprise data policies. Your source code, project files, and development context never leave your machine through Pilot. Enterprises using Claude Code with their own API key or Anthropic Enterprise subscription can add Pilot without changing their data compliance posture.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What are the licenses of Pilot's dependencies?</b></summary>

All external tools and dependencies that Pilot installs and uses are open source with permissive licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD). This includes ruff, basedpyright, Prettier, ESLint, gofmt, uv, Vexor, playwright-cli, and all MCP servers. No copyleft or restrictive-licensed dependencies are introduced into your environment.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do I need a separate Anthropic subscription?</b></summary>

Yes. Pilot enhances Claude Code — it doesn't replace it. You need an active Claude subscription (Max, Team, or Enterprise) or an Anthropic API key. Pilot adds quality automation on top of whatever Claude Code access you already have.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does Pilot work with any programming language?</b></summary>

Pilot's quality hooks (auto-formatting, linting, type checking) currently support Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Go out of the box. TDD enforcement, spec-driven development, Endless Mode, persistent memory, and all rules and standards work with any language that Claude Code supports. You can add custom hooks for additional languages.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use Pilot on multiple projects?</b></summary>

Yes. Pilot installs once and works across all your projects. Each project can have its own `.claude/` rules, custom skills, and MCP servers. Run `/sync` in each project to generate project-specific documentation and standards.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I customize the rules and hooks?</b></summary>

Yes. All rules in `.claude/rules/` are markdown files you can edit, extend, or replace. Hooks are Python scripts you can modify. Built-in coding standards are conditional rules that activate by file type and can be customized. You can also create custom skills via `/learn`. Project-specific rules override global defaults. Use `/vault` to share customizations across your team.
