## 📦 What's Inside

<img src="docs/img/ide-screenshot.png" alt="IDE Screenshot" width="600">

### 📋 Flexible Development Workflows via Slash Commands

**Quick Development** (For fast fixes, refactoring, experiments):
- `/quick` - Fast, focused development without spec-driven overhead → No mandatory TDD (Sonnet 4.5)

**Spec-Driven Workflow** (For complex features requiring planning and testing):
- `/plan` - Based on your input asks the right questions → Detailed spec with exact code (Opus 4.1)
- `/implement` - Execute spec with mandatory TDD → Auto-manages context when full (Sonnet 4.5)
- `/remember` - Stores learnings in cross-session memory → Continue after /clear (Sonnet 4.5)
- `/verify` - E2E spec verification with CodeRabbit AI review → All tests, quality, security (Sonnet 4.5)

### 💡 Modular Rules System with Auto-Generated Commands & Skills
- **Rules Builder** - Automatically assembles commands and skills from markdown rules on every `cc` startup
- **Core Rules** - Coding standards, TDD enforcement, error handling, validation, context management
- **Extended Rules** - Domain-specific rules auto-converted to skills (@backend-api, @frontend-components, etc.)
- **Workflow Rules** - Command-specific behavior for /plan, /implement, /verify, /quick, /remember
- **Flexible Customization** - Edit `.claude/rules/config.yaml` to adjust which rules apply to which commands

### 🔌 Enhanced Context and Capabilities via MCP Servers
- **Cipher & Claude Context** - Cross-session memory and semantic code search for optimal context
- **Context7 & Ref** - Up-to-date library documentation with limited context blur
- **DBHub & FireCrawl** - Database access and web scraping for dynamic data retrieval
- **MCP Funnel** - Allows to plug-in more MCP servers as needed without wasting context

### 🛠️ Testing and Quality via Automated Tool Installation
- **CodeRabbit** - AI-powered code review for quality and security
- **Qlty** - Automated code quality hooks for all programming languages
- **Newman** - API end-to-end testing with Postman collections
- **uv, ruff, mypy, basedpyright** - Python linter, formatter, and type checker

### 🏗️ Automated Dev Container Setup (VS Code / Cursor / Windsurf)
- **Integrated Features** - Zsh, Node.js, Docker-in-Docker, uv, ruff, basedpyright, git, fzf
- **IDE Extensions** - Python, Docker, SQL, testing, formatting, and development tools
- **CLI Tools** - qlty, Claude Code, Statusline, dotenvx, CodeRabbit, Cipher, Newman
- **Local Database** - Local PostgreSQL instance on port 5433 for development and testing

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

- **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)** or **[OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/download)**
- **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** or **[Cursor](https://cursor.com/)** or **[Windsurf](https://windsurf.dev/)**
- **[Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)**
- **Optional**: **[Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)** for the best terminal experience

### 📥 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxritter/claude-codepro.git
```
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your credentials and API keys
```bash
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
```
3. Open folder in VS Code, click on the button on the bottom-left: `Reopen in Container` or open the command pallette via `Ctrl + Shift + P` and then use `> Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
4. Wait for automatic build to finish, this can take a couple of minutes (feel free to watch the logs in `Terminal`)
<img src="docs/img/ide-setup-finish.png" alt="Setup finish Screenshot" width="600">

5. Run `cr` to finish CodeRabbit setup, and `cc` (which is an alias we created) in the Terminal to finish the CC setup
```bash
cr # coderabbit cmd line tool and setup. After sign in close with CTRL + C
cc # alias to spawn claude code with loaded environment variables
```

## 📒 How-to-use

### ⚙️ Configuration

1. Open Claude Code in the IDE Terminal, Extension or an external Terminal like Warp with the `cc` command

2. In CC, run `/config` to set `Auto-connect to IDE=true` and set `Auto-compact=false` for best experience
<img src="docs/img/ide-setup-config.png" alt="Setup config Screenshot" width="600">

3. In CC, run `/ide` to connect to VS Code diagnostics and make sure all MCP servers for `/mcp` are online
<img src="docs/img/ide-setup-mcp.png" alt="Setup mcp Screenshot" width="600">

4. In CC, run `/context` to verify context looks similar to this screenshot with less than 20% used
<img src="docs/img/ide-setup-context.png" alt="Setup context Screenshot" width="600">

5. In VS Code, click `START` in the lower bar of the IDE to start a split terminal and monitor CC usage with `/usage`

### 👣 First Steps

**For Quick Changes:**
- Use `/quick` - Fast development for fixes, refactoring, or experiments without spec overhead
- TDD not enforced, but best practices still apply via core rules and auto-injected skills

**For Complex Features (Spec-Driven & TDD):**
- Start with `/plan` - Provide your input and it will ask clarifying questions to create a spec
- Use `/implement` to execute the spec with automatic TDD, best practices and context management
- When context fills, `/remember` automatically updates your plan and stores learnings
- After spec completion, run `/verify` to run CodeRabbit AI review, all tests, and quality checks

### 🎯 Rules Builder
The system uses a modular rules-based architecture that automatically generates slash commands and skills:

- `.claude/rules/core/` - Fundamental rules injected into all commands
- `.claude/rules/workflow/` - Command-specific behavior (plan.md, implement.md, verify.md, quick.md, remember.md)
- `.claude/rules/extended/` - Domain-specific rules auto-converted to individual skills
- `.claude/rules/config.yaml` - Defines which rules are included in which commands
- `.claude/rules/builder.py` - Assembles markdown rules into commands and skills

**Auto-Rebuild:** Commands and skills are automatically regenerated on every `cc` startup, making customization seamless.

## ⚖️ What Makes This Different

**Compared to Other Spec-Driven Frameworks (SpecKit, AgentOS, OpenSpec):**

- 💾 **Persistent Memory** - Cross-session memory maintains knowledge between resets
- ⚡ **Token-Optimized** - No tokens wasted during too complex planning, just works
- ✅ **Production-Grade** - Actively used in client and enterprise projects
- 📝 **Enforced TDD** - Code written before tests gets deleted automatically
- 💯 **Real Verification** - Must show actual outputs based on tests, not assumptions
- 🛠️ **Complete Ecosystem** - Skills, MCP servers, testing tools are integrated and configured
- 📦 **Works Immediately** - Pre-configured automated setup with everything you need

---

## 👥 Who This Is For

- **Professional Developers** - Shipping to production with quality standards
- **Solo Builders** - Managing complex features without losing context
- **Engineering Teams** - Ensuring consistent TDD and code quality
- **Frustrated Coders** - Tired of half-tested, "should work" implementations
