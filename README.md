## TL;DR

First, `cd` into your project folder, then run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxritter/claude-pilot/main/install.sh | bash
```

After installation, run `pilot` to launch Claude Pilot. Use `/sync` to load rules and `/spec` for planned features.

## 🎯 The Problem

Claude Code writes code fast. But without structure, you get:

- **No tests** — Code ships without verification
- **Context decay** — Quality degrades as the context window fills
- **Session amnesia** — Every restart, you re-explain everything
- **Inconsistent results** — Same prompt, different outcomes

Sound familiar? Pilot fixes that.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

Choose your installation method:

**Option A: 🍺 Local Installation**

Install directly on your system using Homebrew. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL2).

**Option B: 🐳 Dev Container**

Pre-configured, isolated environment with all tools ready. No system conflicts and works on any OS.

### 🔧 Installation

`cd` into your project folder, then run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxritter/claude-pilot/main/install.sh | bash
```

After installation, run `pilot` or `ccp` in your project folder to start Claude Pilot.

### 📌 Installing a Specific Version

If the current version has issues, you can install a specific stable version (see [releases](https://github.com/maxritter/claude-pilot/releases)):

```bash
VERSION=6.0.5 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxritter/claude-pilot/main/install.sh | bash
```

## 📦 What's Inside

### ♾️ Endless Mode

- **Seamless Continuity** - Work on complex features across multiple sessions without losing progress
- **Automatic Handoffs** - Context Monitor detects limits and continues seamlessly in new sessions
- **Persistent Memory** - Relevant observations automatically carry across all sessions
- **Works Everywhere** - Both `/spec` workflow and Quick Mode benefit from session continuity

### 📋 Spec-Driven Development

- **Planning** - Creates a detailed implementation plan for your review as markdown in `docs/plans/`
- **Approval** - You review, edit if needed, and approve the plan before implementation
- **Implementation** - Executes the plan with TDD enforcement and context management
- **Verification** - Runs tests, quality checks, and validates completion based on the plan

### 📚 Modular Rules, Commands & Skills

- **Rules** - Best practices for TDD, debugging, context management, and more
- **Commands** - `/spec` for SDD, `/sync` for updating rules, `/learn` for online learning
- **Skills** - Coding standards for Python, TypeScript, Go, testing, and components
- **Customizable** - Add your own rules, commands, and skills that survive updates

### 🧠 Enhanced Context Capabilities

- **Persistent Memory** - Cross-session memory system that automatically ingests context
- **Semantic Search** - Local vector store based semantic code search for token-efficient retrieval
- **External Context** - Library docs via Context7, web search and scraping via MCP tools
- **Browser Automation** - E2E UI testing with headless browser for frontend verification

### ✅ Quality Automation

- **TDD Enforcer** - Pre-edit hook that warns when modifying code without failing tests first
- **Quality Hooks** - Language-specific hooks for Python, TypeScript and Go that auto-fix issues
- **LSP Integration** - Language servers installed for real-time diagnostics and go-to-definitions
- **Status Line** - Live display of context usage, memory status, usage limits, and license info

### 🛠️ One-Command Installer

- **Automated Container Setup** - Isolated Linux environment with pre-configured tools and extensions
- **Extended Language Support** - Optionally install extended support for Python, TypeScript & Go
- **Automated Updater** - Updates Pilot to the latest version when launched over the binary
- **Shell Integration** - Auto-configures bash, fish and zsh with `pilot` alias (and `ccp` for migration)

## 🔄 Before & After

| Without Pilot | With Pilot |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| Writes code, skips tests | TDD enforced — tests first |
| No quality checks | Auto-linted, formatted, type-checked |
| Context degrades mid-task | Endless Mode preserves context |
| Every session starts fresh | Persistent memory across sessions |
| Hope it works | Verified before marked complete |

---

## ⚡ Usage

### 🔄 Sync Rules & Skills

Run `/sync` to sync custom rules and skills with your codebase. Run it once initially, then anytime again:

```bash
pilot
> /sync
```

### 📋 Spec-Driven Mode

Best for complex features, refactoring, or when you want to review a plan before implementation:

```bash
pilot
> /spec "Add user authentication with OAuth and JWT tokens"
```

**How it works:**

```
📋 Plan  →  ✅ Approve  →  🔨 Implement  →  🔍 Verify
                                ↑              ↓
                                └── 🔄 Loop ───┘
```

1. **📋 Plan** — Explores codebase, asks clarifying questions, writes spec to `docs/plans/`
2. **✅ Approve** — You review and edit the plan, then approve
3. **🔨 Implement** — Executes each task with TDD and quality hooks
4. **🔍 Verify** — Runs tests and checks; loops back if issues found

### 💬 Quick Mode

Just chat. No plan file, no approval gate. All quality hooks and TDD enforcement still apply.

Best for bug fixes, small improvements, and exploratory work:

```bash
pilot
> Fix the null pointer bug in user.py
```

### 🧠 Online Learning

Capture non-obvious discoveries as reusable skills. Automatically prompted by the context monitor or manually:

```bash
pilot
> /learn "Extract the debugging workflow we used for the race condition"
```

### 📐 Rules, Commands & Skills

Create your own rules, commands or skills in your project's `.claude/` folder:

| Type         | Loaded                            | Best for                                |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Rules**    | Every session (always in context) | Guidelines Claude should always follow  |
| **Commands** | On demand via `/command`          | Specific workflows or multi-step tasks  |
| **Skills**   | Dynamically when relevant         | Specialized knowledge for specific tasks |

Claude Pilot automatically installs best-practice rules, commands, and coding standard skills.

### 👥 Team Vault

Share rules, commands, and skills across your team via a private Git repository:

```bash
pilot
> /sync  # Configure team vault and sync assets
```

- **Private** - Use any Git repo (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket - public or private)
- **Pull** - Install shared assets from your team's vault
- **Push** - Share your custom rules and skills with teammates
- **Version** - Assets are versioned automatically (v1, v2, v3...)

### 🔌 Custom MCP Servers

Add your own MCP servers in two locations:

| Config File | How It Works | Best For |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| `.mcp.json` | Instructions load into context when triggered | Lightweight servers (few tools) |
| `mcp_servers.json` | Called via mcp-cli; instructions never enter context | Heavy servers (many tools) |

Run `/sync` after adding servers to generate documentation.
