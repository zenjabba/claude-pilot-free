## ⚡ TL;DR

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxritter/claude-codepro/v5.1.5/install.sh | bash
```

Then run `ccp` and `/setup` once. Use `/spec` or the quick mode for full quality.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

Choose your installation method:

**Option A: 🐳 Dev Container (Recommended - All Platforms)**
- **Container Runtime** - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or compatible equivalent
- **IDE** - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), or [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)
- **Dev Containers extension** - [Install from Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- Works on **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows (with WSL2)**

**Option B: 🍺 Local Installation (Only macOS/Linux)**
- **macOS or Linux** - Homebrew-compatible system
- **Homebrew** - Installed automatically if not present

**Claude Subscription:** Claude Max 5x/20x or Enterprise recommended for best experience.

### 🔧 Installation

Run the following command in your **project folder root**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxritter/claude-codepro/v5.1.5/install.sh | bash
```

You'll be asked to choose between **Dev Container** or **Local Installation**.

## 📦 What's Inside

### ♾️ Endless Mode

- **Seamless Continuity** - Work on complex features across multiple sessions without losing progress
- **Automatic Handoffs** - Context Monitor detects limits and continues seamlessly in new sessions
- **Persistent Memory** - Relevant observations automatically carry across all sessions
- **Works Everywhere** - Both `/spec` workflow and Quick Mode benefit from session continuity

### 📋 Spec-Driven Development

- **Planning** - Creates a detailed implementation plan for your review as markdown in `docs/plans/`
- **Approval** - You review, edit if needed, and approve the plan before implementation
- **Implementation** - Executes the plan with TDD enforcement and context management
- **Verification** - Runs tests, quality checks, and validates completion based on the plan

### 📚 Modular Rules System

- **Standard Rules** - Best-Practices for TDD, Context Management, etc. in `.claude/rules/standard/`
- **Custom Rules** - Project-specific rules in `.claude/rules/custom/` (never touched by updates)
- **Command Skills** - Workflow-specific modes: `/spec`, `/setup`, `/plan`, `/implement`, `/verify`
- **Standards Skills** - Best-Practices for Frontend, Backend, Testing, etc. automatically injected

### 🧠 Enhanced Context Capabilities

- **Persistent Memory** - Cross-session memory system that automatically ingests context
- **Semantic Search** - Local vector store based semantic code search for token-efficient retrieval
- **External Context** - External context retrieval for code / libraries and web search / scraping
- **Browser Automation** - Headless browser automation and testing even within the Dev Container

### ✅ Quality Automation

- **TDD Enforcer** - Pre-edit hook that warns when modifying code without failing tests first
- **Quality Hooks** - Specific hooks for Python, TypeScript and Go, all other languages via qlty
- **Context Monitor** - Tracks context usage and triggers automatic session handoffs
- **Status Line** - Live display of context usage, memory status, usage limits, and license info

### 🛠️ One-Command Installer

- **Automated Container Setup** - Isolated Linux environment with pre-configured tools and extensions
- **Extended Language Support** - Optionally install extended support for Python, TypeScript & Go
- **Automated Updater** - Updates CCP to the latest version when launched over the binary
- **Shell Integration** - Auto-configures bash, fish and zsh with `ccp` alias

## 🔄 Why Claude CodePro?

Same task. Different results.

| Ad-hoc Prompting | With Claude CodePro |
|------------------|---------------------|
| ❌ Writes code without tests | ✅ TDD enforced — tests first, then implementation |
| ❌ No quality checks | ✅ Auto-formatted, linted, type-checked on every edit |
| ❌ Inconsistent workflow | ✅ Structured Plan → Implement → Verify cycle |
| ❌ Context lost between sessions | ✅ Persistent memory carries observations forward |
| ❌ No codebase awareness | ✅ Semantic search understands your code |
| ❌ Hope it works | ✅ Verified before marked complete |

**The result:** Production-grade code you can ship with confidence. Systematic. Tested. Verified.

## ⚡ Usage

### 🔧 First Time Setup

Run `/setup` once per project to initialize context and semantic search:

```bash
ccp
> /setup
```

### 📋 Spec-Driven Mode

Best for complex features, refactoring, or when you want to review a plan before implementation:

```bash
ccp
> /spec "Add user authentication with OAuth and JWT tokens"
```

**How it works:**

```
📋 Plan  →  ✅ Approve  →  🔨 Implement  →  🔍 Verify
                                ↑              ↓
                                └── 🔄 Loop ───┘
```

1. **📋 Plan** — Explores codebase, asks clarifying questions, writes spec to `docs/plans/`
2. **✅ Approve** — You review and edit the plan, then approve
3. **🔨 Implement** — Executes each task with TDD and quality hooks
4. **🔍 Verify** — Runs tests and checks; loops back if issues found

### 💬 Quick Mode

Just chat. No plan file, no approval gate. All quality hooks and TDD enforcement still apply.

Best for bug fixes, small improvements, and exploratory work:

```bash
ccp
> Fix the null pointer bug in user.py
```

### 📐 Rules System

Claude CodePro uses [Claude Code's modular rules](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#modular-rules-with-claude/rules/):

- **Standard Rules** in `.claude/rules/standard/` - Best-Practices updated on install, don't modify those
- **Custom Rules** in `.claude/rules/custom/` - Your project-specific rules, never touched by updates
- **Quality Hooks** - Pre-edit and post-edit hooks that enforce standards automatically
