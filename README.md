## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Container Runtime** - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) (macOS)
- **IDE** - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/editor), or [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/)
- **Dev Containers extension** - [Install from Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

> **Note:** Claude CodePro runs inside a Dev Container for complete isolation, consistent tooling, and cross-platform compatibility.

### Installation

Claude CodePro can be installed into any existing project:

1. Open your project folder in your IDE
2. Run this command in the terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxritter/claude-codepro/v3.3.7/install.sh | bash
```

3. Reopen in Container: `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
4. Installation completes automatically inside the container

> **Cursor, Windsurf, Antigravity users:** These IDEs don't auto-execute `postCreateCommand`. After the container starts, run the install command from step 2 again.

## 📦 What's Inside

### 📋 Spec-Driven Workflow via Slash Commands

- `/setup` - Initialize project context, semantic search indexing, and persistent memory
- `/plan` - Based on your input asks the right questions → Detailed spec with exact code
- `/implement` - Execute spec with mandatory TDD → Auto-manages context when full
- `/verify` - End-to-end spec verification → All tests, quality, security

### 💡 Modular Rules System

- **Auto Loading** - Claude Code automatically loads all `.claude/rules/*.md` files as project memory
- **Standard Rules** - Best-Practices for TDD, Context Management, etc. in `.claude/rules/standard/`
- **Custom Rules** - Project-specific rules in `.claude/rules/custom/` (never touched by updates)
- **Commands** - Workflow-specific modes: /plan, /implement, /verify, /setup
- **Skills** - Domain-specific @-referenceable guides (e.g., @backend-python-standards)

### 🔌 Enhanced Context and Capabilities via MCP Servers

- **Claude Mem** - Cross-session persistent memory system that automatically ingest context
- **Claude Context** - Local vector store based semantic code search for token-efficient retrieval
- **Tavily** - Real-time web search capabilities and powerful web mapping tool
- **Ref** - AI-powered code context retrieval, similar to Context7 but uses less context
- **MCP Lazy Loading** - Intelligently reduces context usage by lazy loading MCP servers

### 🛠️ Intelligent Hooks for Quality, Standards and Context

- **Qlty Quality** - Post-edit hook for automated formatting and code checking for all languages
- **Python Quality** - Post-edit hook for uv, ruff, mypy, basedpyright linting and type checking (optional)
- **TDD Enforcer** - Pre-edit hook that warns when modifying code without failing tests first
- **Context Monitor** - Post-tool hook that warns CC automatically at 85%/95% context usage
- **Claude Memory** - Various hooks that intelligently manage Claude Memory context injection via claude-mem

### 🏗️ One-Command Installation

- **LSP Servers** - Python and TypeScript CC Language Servers for extended code intelligence
- **Dev Container Required** - Isolated Linux environment with pre-configured tools and extensions
- **Automated Setup Script** - Installs and configures everything in one command
- **Shell Integration** - Auto-configures bash, fish and zsh with `ccp` alias
- **IDE Compatible** - Works with VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf or Antigravity

## 📒 How-to-use

### ⚙️ Configuration

1. Open Claude Code in the IDE Terminal, Extension or an external Terminal with the `ccp` command

2. In CC, run `/config` and make sure the configuration looks similar to this screenshot
   <img src="docs/img/ide-setup-config.png" alt="Setup config Screenshot" width="600">

3. In CC, run `/ide` to connect to VS Code diagnostics and make sure all MCP servers for `/mcp` are online
   <img src="docs/img/ide-setup-mcp.png" alt="Setup mcp Screenshot" width="600">

4. In CC, run `/context` to verify context looks similar to this screenshot with rules loaded

### ⚠️ Important: Context Management

**Never use `/compact`** - Claude CodePro is designed to use the full 200k context window:

- **Auto-compact must be disabled** in `/config`
- **Ignore the compact warning** in the bottom right of Claude Code - it appears too early
- **Use the full context** during `/implement` sessions until context is actually full
- **When context is full**, run `/clear` to start a fresh session
- **Claude Mem auto-injects** relevant context from your previous session when you continue with `/implement`

This approach ensures maximum context utilization and seamless session continuity via persistent memory.

### 👣 First Steps

- Start with `/plan` - Provide your input and it will ask clarifying questions to create a spec
- Use `/implement` to execute the spec with automatic TDD, best practices and context management
- When context fills up, run `/clear` then continue with `/implement` mentioning your plan file
- After spec completion, run `/verify` to run end-to-end review, all tests, and quality checks

### 🎯 Customizing Rules

Claude CodePro uses [Claude Code's modular rules](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#modular-rules-with-claude/rules/):

- **Standard Rules** in `.claude/rules/standard/` - Updated on install, don't modify
- **Custom Rules** in `.claude/rules/custom/` - Your project-specific rules, never touched by updates
- **Path-Specific Rules** - Use YAML frontmatter with `paths:` to scope rules to specific files

Add custom rules by creating `.md` files in `.claude/rules/custom/`. You can also use path-specific rules:

```yaml
---
paths: src/**/*.py
---
# Python-specific rules for this project
```
