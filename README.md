## 🚀 Getting Started

Run this command in **any project directory** for a **fresh install** or to **update to the latest version**:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxritter/claude-codepro/v2.5.15/scripts/install.py -o /tmp/claude-codepro-install.py && python3 /tmp/claude-codepro-install.py
```

The installer will guide you through the setup process with interactive prompts.

**Recommended:** Install via Dev Container for complete isolation from your host system. The installer will offer to set up the dev container configuration automatically.

**Alternative:** Install directly on your host system. This may interfere with existing packages and settings, therefore it is not recommend unless you know what to do.

## 📦 What's Inside

### 📋 Spec-Driven Workflow via Slash Commands

- `/setup` - Initialize project context, semantic search indexing, and persistent memory
- `/plan` - Based on your input asks the right questions → Detailed spec with exact code
- `/implement` - Execute spec with mandatory TDD → Auto-manages context when full
- `/verify` - End-to-end spec verification → All tests, quality, security
- `/remember` - Stores learnings in cross-session memory → Continue after /clear

### 💡 Context-Loaded Rules System

- **Auto-Generated** - Regenerated on every `ccp` command from `.claude/rules/` markdown files
- **Standard Rules** - Best-Practices for TDD, Context Management, etc. loaded into `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- **Custom Rules** - Project-specific rules (never touched by updates) loaded into `CLAUDE.local.md`
- **Commands** - Workflow-specific modes: /plan, /implement, /verify, /remember, /setup
- **Skills** - Domain-specific @-referenceable guides (e.g., @backend-python-standards)

### 🔌 Enhanced Context and Capabilities via MCP Servers

- **Cipher** - Cross-session memory for persistent knowledge and learnings stored in Vector DB
- **Claude Context** - Semantic code search for optimal codebase context retrieval
- **Exa** - AI-powered web search, code context retrieval, and URL content extraction
- **MCP Funnel** - Allows to plug-in more MCP servers as needed without wasting context

### 🛠️ Testing and Quality via Automated Tool Installation

- **Post-Edit Hooks** - Automated formatting and code checking after every edit
- **Qlty** - Automated code quality hooks for all programming languages
- **uv, ruff, mypy, basedpyright** - Python linter, formatter, and type checker (optional)
- **Newman** - API end-to-end testing with Postman collections

### 🏗️ One-Command Installation

- **Dev Container Support** - Isolated development environment with pre-configured tools and extensions
- **Automated Setup Script** - Installs and configures everything in one command
- **Global Tools** - Python tools, qlty, Claude Code, Cipher, Newman installed globally
- **Shell Integration** - Auto-configures bash and zsh with `ccp` alias
- **IDE Compatible** - Works with VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf or Antigravity

## 📒 How-to-use

### ⚙️ Configuration

1. Open Claude Code in the IDE Terminal, Extension or an external Terminal with the `ccp` command

2. In CC, run `/config` to set `Auto-connect to IDE=true` and set `Auto-compact=false` for best experience

3. In CC, run `/ide` to connect to VS Code diagnostics and make sure all MCP servers for `/mcp` are online

4. In CC, run `/context` to verify context looks similar to this screenshot with less than 20% used

### 👣 First Steps

- Start with `/plan` - Provide your input and it will ask clarifying questions to create a spec
- Use `/implement` to execute the spec with automatic TDD, best practices and context management
- When context fills, `/remember` automatically updates your plan and stores learnings
- After spec completion, run `/verify` to run end-to-end review, all tests, and quality checks

### 🎯 Customizing Rules

- **Standard Rules** in `.claude/rules/standard/` - Updated on install, don't modify
- **Custom Rules** in `.claude/rules/custom/` - Your project-specific rules, never touched by updates
- **Auto-Build** - `ccp` regenerates `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/CLAUDE.local.md` at startup

Add custom rules by creating `.md` files in `.claude/rules/custom/` - they'll be included automatically on next `ccp` start.

## ⚖️ What Makes This Different

**Compared to Other Spec-Driven Frameworks (SpecKit, AgentOS, OpenSpec):**

- 📦 **One-Line Installation** - No containers, no complex setup, just one curl command
- 🤓 **Language Agnostic** - Works with Python, Node.js, Go, Rust, or any language
- 💾 **Persistent Memory** - Cross-session memory maintains knowledge between resets
- ⚡ **Token-Optimized** - No tokens wasted during too complex planning, just works
- ✅ **Production-Grade** - Actively used in client and enterprise projects
- 📝 **Enforced TDD** - Code written before tests gets deleted automatically
- 💯 **Real Verification** - Must show actual outputs based on tests, not assumptions
- 🛠️ **Complete Ecosystem** - Skills, MCP servers, testing tools are integrated and configured

---

## 👥 Who This Is For

- **Professional Developers** - Shipping to production with quality standards
- **Solo Builders** - Managing complex features without losing context
- **Engineering Teams** - Ensuring consistent TDD and code quality
- **Frustrated Coders** - Tired of half-tested, "should work" implementations
