## When to use this skill

- When creating or modifying layouts that need to work on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- When implementing mobile-first design patterns starting with mobile layout
- When writing media queries or breakpoint-specific styles
- When using flexible units (rem, em, %) instead of fixed pixels for scalability
- When implementing fluid layouts with percentage-based widths or flexbox/grid
- When ensuring touch targets meet minimum size requirements (44x44px) for mobile
- When optimizing images and assets for different screen sizes and mobile networks
- When testing UI across multiple device sizes and breakpoints
- When maintaining readable typography across all screen sizes
- When prioritizing content display on smaller screens through layout decisions

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle frontend responsive.

## Instructions

- **Mobile-First Development**: Start with mobile layout and progressively enhance for larger screens
- **Standard Breakpoints**: Consistently use standard breakpoints across the application (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **Fluid Layouts**: Use percentage-based widths and flexible containers that adapt to screen size
- **Relative Units**: Prefer rem/em units over fixed pixels for better scalability and accessibility
- **Test Across Devices**: Test and verify UI changes across multiple screen sizes from mobile to tablet to desktop screen sizes and ensure a balanced, user-friendly viewing and reading experience on all
- **Touch-Friendly Design**: Ensure tap targets are appropriately sized (minimum 44x44px) for mobile users
- **Performance on Mobile**: Optimize images and assets for mobile network conditions and smaller screens
- **Readable Typography**: Maintain readable font sizes across all breakpoints without requiring zoom
- **Content Priority**: Show the most important content first on smaller screens through thoughtful layout decisions
