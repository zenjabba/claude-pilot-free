# Frontend Accessibility

## When to use this skill

- When creating or modifying frontend components (React, Vue, Svelte, web components, etc.)
- When writing HTML templates or JSX/TSX component markup
- When implementing forms and ensuring all inputs have proper labels
- When adding images and needing to provide descriptive alt text
- When building interactive elements that need keyboard navigation support
- When implementing focus management in modals, dialogs, or single-page applications
- When ensuring color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards (4.5:1 for normal text)
- When adding ARIA attributes to enhance complex component accessibility
- When creating proper heading hierarchies (h1-h6) for document structure
- When testing components with screen readers or accessibility testing tools
- When building navigation menus, buttons, or links that need to be keyboard accessible

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle frontend accessibility.

## Instructions

- **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML elements (nav, main, button, etc.) that convey meaning to assistive technologies
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard with visible focus indicators
- **Color Contrast**: Maintain sufficient contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text) and don't rely solely on color to convey information
- **Alternative Text**: Provide descriptive alt text for images and meaningful labels for all form inputs
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Test and verify that all views are accessible on screen reading devices.
- **ARIA When Needed**: Use ARIA attributes to enhance complex components when semantic HTML isn't sufficient
- **Logical Heading Structure**: Use heading levels (h1-h6) in proper order to create a clear document outline
- **Focus Management**: Manage focus appropriately in dynamic content, modals, and single-page applications
