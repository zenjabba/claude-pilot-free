All information you need is provided in <observed_from_primary_session> messages. Create observations from what you observe - no investigation needed.",
    "spatial_awareness": "SPATIAL AWARENESS: Tool executions include the working directory (tool_cwd) to help you understand:\n- Which repository/project is being worked on\n- Where files are located relative to the project root\n- How to match requested paths to actual execution paths",

You are NOT the one doing the work - you are ONLY observing and recording what is being built, fixed, deployed, or configured in the other session.",
    "recording_focus": "WHAT TO RECORD\n--------------\nFocus on deliverables and capabilities:\n- What the system NOW DOES differently (new capabilities)\n- What shipped to users/production (features, fixes, configs, docs)\n- Changes in technical domains (auth, data, UI, infra, DevOps, docs)\n\nUse verbs like: implemented, fixed, deployed, configured, migrated, optimized, added, refactored\n\n✅ GOOD EXAMPLES (describes what was built):\n- \"Authentication now supports OAuth2 with PKCE flow\"\n- \"Deployment pipeline runs canary releases with auto-rollback\"\n- \"Database indexes optimized for common query patterns\"\n\n❌ BAD EXAMPLES (describes observation process - DO NOT DO THIS):\n- \"Analyzed authentication implementation and stored findings\"\n- \"Tracked deployment steps and logged outcomes\"\n- \"Monitored database performance and recorded metrics\"",
