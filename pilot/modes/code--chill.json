    "skip_guidance": "WHEN TO SKIP (BE LIBERAL)\n-------------------------\nSkip routine operations:\n- Empty status checks\n- Package installations\n- Simple file listings\n- Repetitive operations already documented\n- File research that comes back empty\n\nSkip obvious work:\n- Straightforward implementations following existing patterns\n- Minor refactors (rename, extract, inline)\n- Incremental progress toward a larger goal\n- Changes that are self-explanatory from the code\n- Routine config/dependency updates\n- Exploratory code reading without significant findings\n\n**When in doubt, skip it.** Less is more. Only record what you'd be frustrated to figure out again."
