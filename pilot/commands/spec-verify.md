# /spec-verify - Verification Phase

**Phase 3 of the /spec workflow.** Runs comprehensive verification: tests, process compliance, code review, program execution, E2E tests, and edge case testing.

**Input:** Path to a plan file with `Status: COMPLETE`
**Output:** Plan status set to VERIFIED (success) or looped back to implementation (failure)
**On success:** Workflow complete
**On failure:** → `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')` to fix issues

---

## ⛔ KEY CONSTRAINTS (Rules Summary)

| # | Rule |
|---|------|
| 1 | **NEVER SKIP verification** - Code review (Step 3.5) is mandatory. No exceptions. |
| 2 | **NO stopping** - Everything is automatic. Never ask "Should I fix these?" |
| 3 | **Fix ALL findings automatically** - must_fix AND should_fix. No permission needed. |
| 4 | **Quality over speed** - Never rush due to context pressure |
| 5 | **Plan file is source of truth** - Survives session clears |
| 6 | **Code changes finish BEFORE runtime testing** - Code review and fixes happen before build/deploy/E2E |
| 7 | **Re-verification after fixes is MANDATORY** - Fixes can introduce new bugs. Always re-verify. |

---

## The Process

The verification process is split into two phases. All code changes (from review findings) happen in Phase A. All runtime testing happens in Phase B against the finalized code.

```
Phase A — Finalize the code:
  Tests → Process Compliance → Code Review → Fix → Re-verify loop

Phase B — Verify the running program:
  Build → Deploy → Code Identity Check → Program Execution → DoD Audit → E2E → Edge Cases

Final:
  Regression check → Update plan status
```

**Why this order:** Code review findings change the code. If you run E2E before code review, you test unfixed code and must re-test after fixes. By finishing all code changes first, E2E tests the final product exactly once.

**All test levels are MANDATORY:** Unit tests alone are insufficient. You must run integration tests AND E2E tests AND execute the actual program with real data.

---

## Phase A: Finalize the Code

### Step 3.1: Run & Fix Tests

Run the full test suite (unit + integration) and fix any failures immediately.

**If failures:** Identify → Read test → Fix implementation → Re-run → Continue until all pass

### Step 3.2: Process Compliance Check

Run mechanical verification tools. These check process adherence that the code review agent cannot assess.

**Run each tool and show output:**

1. **Type checker** — `tsc --noEmit` / `basedpyright` / equivalent
2. **Linter** — `eslint` / `ruff check` / equivalent
3. **Coverage** — Run with coverage flag, verify ≥ 80%
4. **Build** — Clean build with no errors

**Fix all errors before proceeding.** Warnings are acceptable; errors are blockers.

**Note:** The spec-verifier agent handles code quality, spec compliance, and rules enforcement. This step only covers mechanical tool checks that produce binary pass/fail results.

### Step 3.3: Feature Parity Check (if applicable)

**For refactoring/migration tasks only:** Verify ALL original functionality is preserved.

**Process:**
1. Compare old implementation with new implementation
2. Create checklist of features from old code
3. Verify each feature exists in new code
4. Run new code and verify same behavior as old code

**If features are MISSING:**

This is a serious issue - the implementation is incomplete.

1. **Add new tasks to the plan file:**
   - Read the existing plan
   - Add new tasks for each missing feature (follow existing task format)
   - Mark new tasks with `[MISSING]` prefix in task title
   - Update the Progress Tracking section with new task count
   - Add note: `> Extended [Date]: Tasks X-Y added for missing features found during verification`

2. **Set plan status to PENDING and increment Iterations:**
   ```
   Edit the plan file:
   Status: COMPLETE  →  Status: PENDING
   Iterations: N     →  Iterations: N+1
   ```

3. **Register status change:** `~/.pilot/bin/pilot register-plan "<plan_path>" "PENDING" 2>/dev/null || true`

4. **Inform user:**
   ```
   🔄 Iteration N+1: Missing features detected, looping back to implement...

   Found [N] missing features that need implementation:
   - [Feature 1]
   - [Feature 2]

   The plan has been updated with [N] new tasks.
   ```

5. **⛔ Phase Transition Context Guard:** Run `~/.pilot/bin/pilot check-context --json`. If >= 80%, hand off instead (see spec.md Section 0.3).
6. **Invoke implementation phase:** `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')`

### Step 3.4: Call Chain Analysis

**Perform deep impact analysis for all changes:**

1. **Trace Upwards (Callers):**
   - Identify all code that calls modified functions
   - Verify they handle new return values/exceptions
   - Check for breaking changes in interfaces

2. **Trace Downwards (Callees):**
   - Identify all dependencies of modified code
   - Verify correct parameter passing
   - Check error handling from callees

3. **Side Effect Analysis:**
   - Database state changes
   - Cache invalidation needs
   - External system impacts
   - Global state modifications

### Step 3.5: Code Review Verification

**⛔ THIS STEP IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. You MUST run code verification.**

**⚠️ SKIPPING THIS STEP IS FORBIDDEN.** Even if:
- You're confident the code is correct
- Context is getting high (do handoff AFTER verification, not instead of it)
- Tests pass (tests don't catch everything)
- The implementation seems simple

**None of these are valid reasons to skip. ALWAYS VERIFY.**

#### 3.5a: Identify Changed Files

Get list of files changed in this implementation:
```bash
git status --short  # Shows staged and unstaged changes
```

#### 3.5b: Gather Context for the Verifier

Before launching the agent, gather information it needs for actionable findings:

1. **Test framework constraints** — What can/can't the test framework test? (e.g., "SSR-only via renderToString — no client-side effects or state testing possible")
2. **Runtime environment** — How to start the program, what port, where artifacts are deployed
3. **Plan risks section** — Copy the Risks and Mitigations table from the plan (if present)

#### 3.5c: Launch Code Verification

Spawn 1 `spec-verifier` agent using the Task tool:

```
Task(
  subagent_type="pilot:spec-verifier",
  prompt="""
  **Plan file:** <plan-path>
  **Changed files:** [file list from git status]

  **Runtime environment:** [how to start, port, deploy path, etc.]
  **Test framework constraints:** [what the test framework can/cannot test]
  **Plan risks section:** [copy risks table if present, or "None listed"]

  Review the implementation against the plan. Read the plan file first to understand
  the requirements, then verify the changed files implement them correctly.
  You may read related files for context as needed.
  """
)
```

The verifier:
- Receives the plan file path as source of truth
- Reads ALL rule files (global + project) and enforces them
- Reviews changed files against plan requirements
- Verifies plan risk mitigations were implemented
- Checks each task's Definition of Done criteria
- Can read related files for context (imports, dependencies, etc.)
- Runs with fresh context (no anchoring bias)
- Returns structured JSON findings

#### 3.5d: Report Findings

Present findings briefly:

```
## Code Verification Complete

**Issues Found:** X

### Must Fix (N) | Should Fix (N) | Suggestions (N)

Implementing fixes automatically...
```

#### 3.5e: Automatically Implement ALL Findings

**⛔ DO NOT ask user for permission. Fix everything automatically.**

This is part of the automated /spec workflow. The user approved the plan - verification fixes are part of that approval. Never stop to ask "Should I fix these?" or "Want me to address these findings?"

**Implementation order (by severity):**

1. **must_fix issues** - Fix immediately (security, crashes, TDD violations)
2. **should_fix issues** - Fix immediately (spec deviations, missing tests, error handling)
3. **suggestions** - Implement if reasonable and quick

**For each fix:**
1. Implement the fix
2. Run relevant tests to verify
3. Log: "✅ Fixed: [issue title]"

### Step 3.6: Re-verification Loop (MANDATORY)

**⛔ This step is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Fixes can introduce new bugs.**

After implementing ALL code review findings from Step 3.5e:

1. **Re-run the spec-verifier agent** with the same parameters as Step 3.5c
2. If new must_fix or should_fix issues found → fix them and re-run again
3. Maximum 3 iterations of the fix → re-verify cycle
4. **Only proceed to Phase B when the verifier returns zero must_fix and zero should_fix**

If iterations exhausted with remaining issues, add them to plan. **⛔ Phase Transition Context Guard** (spec.md Section 0.3) before invoking `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')`

**The only stopping point in /spec is plan approval. Everything else is automatic.**

---

## Phase B: Verify the Running Program

All code is now finalized. No more code changes should happen in this phase (except critical bugs found during execution).

### Step 3.7: Build, Deploy, and Verify Code Identity

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Tests passing ≠ Program works. And building ≠ running your build.**

#### 3.7a: Build

Build/compile the project. Verify zero errors.

#### 3.7b: Deploy (if applicable)

If the project builds artifacts that are deployed separately from source (e.g., bundled JS, compiled binaries, Docker images):

1. Identify where built artifacts are installed (e.g., `~/.claude/pilot/scripts/`)
2. Copy new builds to the installed location
3. Restart any running services that use the old artifacts

**If no separate deployment is needed, skip to 3.7c.**

#### 3.7c: Code Identity Verification (MANDATORY)

**Before testing ANY endpoint or behavior, prove the running instance uses your newly built code.**

1. Identify a behavioral change unique to this implementation (new query parameter, changed response field, new endpoint, different behavior for specific input)
2. Craft a request that ONLY the new code would handle correctly (e.g., filter by nonexistent value should return 0 results; old code returns unfiltered results)
3. Execute the request against the running program
4. **If the response matches OLD behavior** → you are testing stale code
   - Redeploy artifacts
   - Restart the service
   - Re-verify until the response matches NEW behavior
5. **If the response matches NEW behavior** → proceed

**Example:** You added `?project=` filtering. Query `?project=nonexistent-xyz`. New code returns 0 results. Old code ignores the parameter and returns all results. If you see all results, you're testing old code.

**⛔ DO NOT proceed to program execution testing until code identity is confirmed.**

### Step 3.8: Program Execution Verification

Run the actual program and verify real output.

**Execution checklist:**
- [ ] Program starts without errors
- [ ] **Inspect logs** - Check for errors, warnings, stack traces
- [ ] **Verify output correctness** - Fetch source data independently, compare against program output
- [ ] Test with real/sample data, not just mocks

**⛔ Output Correctness - MANDATORY:**
If code processes external data, ALWAYS verify by fetching source data independently and comparing:
```bash
# Fetch actual source data (database query, API call, file contents)
# Compare counts/content with what your code returned
# If mismatch → BUG (don't trust program output alone)
```

**If bugs are found:**

| Bug Type | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Minor** (typo, off-by-one, missing import) | Fix immediately, re-run, continue verification |
| **Major** (logic error, missing function, architectural issue) | Add task to plan, set PENDING, **⛔ Context Guard** (spec.md 0.3), then `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')` |

### Step 3.9: Definition of Done Audit

**For EACH task in the plan**, read its Definition of Done criteria and verify each criterion is met with evidence from the running program.

```markdown
### Task N: [title]
- [ ] DoD criterion 1 → [evidence: command output / API response / screenshot]
- [ ] DoD criterion 2 → [evidence]
...
```

**If any criterion is unmet:**
- If fixable inline → fix immediately
- If structural → add task to plan and loop back to implementation

### Step 3.10: E2E Verification (MANDATORY for apps with UI/API)

**⚠️ Unit + Integration tests are NOT enough. You MUST also run E2E tests.**

#### 3.10a: Happy Path Testing

Test the primary user workflow end-to-end.

**For APIs:** Test endpoints with curl. Verify status codes, response content, and state changes.

**For Frontend/UI:** Use `agent-browser` to verify UI renders and workflows complete. See `~/.claude/rules/agent-browser.md`.

Walk through the main user scenario described in the plan. Every view, every interaction, every state transition.

#### 3.10b: Edge Case and Negative Testing

After the happy path passes, test failure modes. **This is not optional.**

| Category | What to test | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Empty state** | No data, no items, no results | Empty database, no projects, search returns nothing |
| **Invalid input** | Bad parameters, wrong types | SQL injection in query params, empty strings, special characters |
| **Stale state** | Cached/stored data references something deleted | localStorage has project name that no longer exists |
| **Error state** | Backend unreachable, API returns error | What does the UI show when fetch fails? |
| **Boundary** | Maximum values, zero values, single item | Exactly 1 project, 0 observations, 100-char project name |

For each edge case:
1. Set up the condition
2. Exercise the UI/API
3. Verify the result is reasonable (not blank, not broken, not stuck, no unhandled errors)

### Step 3.11: Final Regression Check

Run the test suite and type checker one final time to catch any regressions from Phase B fixes (if any code changed during execution/E2E testing):

1. Run full test suite — all pass
2. Run type checker — zero errors
3. Verify build still succeeds

**If no code changed during Phase B** (no bugs found during execution/E2E), this confirms the same green state from Phase A. Still run it — it's cheap insurance.

### Step 3.12: Update Plan Status

**Status Lifecycle:** `PENDING` → `COMPLETE` → `VERIFIED`

**When ALL verification passes (no missing features, no bugs, rules compliant):**

1. **MANDATORY: Update plan status to VERIFIED**
   ```
   Edit the plan file and change the Status line:
   Status: COMPLETE  →  Status: VERIFIED
   ```
2. **Register status change:** `~/.pilot/bin/pilot register-plan "<plan_path>" "VERIFIED" 2>/dev/null || true`
3. Read the Iterations count from the plan file
4. Report completion:
   ```
   ✅ Workflow complete! Plan status: VERIFIED

   Summary:
   - [Brief summary of what was implemented]
   - [Key files created/modified]
   - [Test results]

   Is there anything else you'd like me to help with?
   ```

**When verification FAILS (missing features, serious bugs, or unfixed rule violations):**

1. Add new tasks to the plan for missing features/bugs
2. **Set status back to PENDING and increment Iterations:**
   ```
   Edit the plan file:
   Status: COMPLETE  →  Status: PENDING
   Iterations: N     →  Iterations: N+1
   ```
3. **Register status change:** `~/.pilot/bin/pilot register-plan "<plan_path>" "PENDING" 2>/dev/null || true`
4. Inform user: "🔄 Iteration N+1: Issues found, fixing and re-verifying..."
5. **⛔ Phase Transition Context Guard:** Run `~/.pilot/bin/pilot check-context --json`. If >= 80%, hand off instead (see spec.md Section 0.3).
6. **Invoke implementation phase:** `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')`

---

## Context Management (90% Handoff)

After each major operation, check context:

```bash
~/.pilot/bin/pilot check-context --json
```

**Between iterations:**
1. If context >= 90%: hand off cleanly (don't rush!)
2. If context 80-89%: continue but wrap up current task with quality
3. If context < 80%: continue the loop freely

If response shows `"status": "CLEAR_NEEDED"` (context >= 90%):

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Execute ALL steps below in a SINGLE turn. DO NOT stop or wait for user response between steps.**

**Step 1: Write continuation file (GUARANTEED BACKUP)**

Write to `~/.pilot/sessions/$PILOT_SESSION_ID/continuation.md`:

```markdown
# Session Continuation (/spec)

**Plan:** <plan-path>
**Phase:** verification
**Current Task:** Step 3.N - [description]

**Completed This Session:**
- [x] [What was finished]

**Next Steps:**
1. [What to do immediately when resuming]

**Context:**
- [Key decisions or blockers]
```

**Step 2: Trigger session clear**

```bash
~/.pilot/bin/pilot send-clear <plan-path>
```

Pilot will restart with `/spec --continue <plan-path>`
