# /spec-plan - Planning Phase

**Phase 1 of the /spec workflow.** Explores the codebase, designs an implementation plan, verifies it, and gets user approval.

**Input:** Task description (new plan) or plan path (continue unapproved plan)
**Output:** Approved plan file at `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
**Next phase:** On approval → `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')`

---

## ⛔ KEY CONSTRAINTS (Rules Summary)

| # | Rule |
|---|------|
| 1 | **NO sub-agents during planning** - Use direct tools only. Exception: Step 1.7 uses `plan-verifier`. |
| 2 | **NEVER SKIP verification** - Plan verification (Step 1.7) is mandatory. No exceptions. |
| 3 | **ONLY stopping point is plan approval** - Everything else is automatic. Never ask "Should I fix these?" |
| 4 | **Batch questions together** - Don't interrupt user flow |
| 5 | **Run explorations sequentially** - One at a time, never in parallel |
| 6 | **NEVER write code during planning** - Separate phases |
| 7 | **NEVER assume - verify by reading files** |
| 8 | **Re-read plan after user edits** - Before asking for approval again |
| 9 | **Quality over speed** - Never rush due to context pressure |
| 10 | **Plan file is source of truth** - Survives session clears |

> **WARNING: DO NOT use the built-in `ExitPlanMode` or `EnterPlanMode` tools.**

## Using AskUserQuestion - Core Planning Tool

**Questions are grouped into batches for smooth user experience:**

| Batch | When | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Batch 1** | Phase 0 (before exploration) | Clarify task, scope, priorities |
| **Batch 2** | Phase 2 (after exploration) | Architecture choices, design decisions |

**When to Use AskUserQuestion:**

| Situation | Example Question |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Unclear requirements** | "Should this feature support batch processing or single items only?" |
| **Multiple valid approaches** | Present 2-3 options with trade-offs for user to choose |
| **Ambiguous scope** | "Should we include error recovery, or fail fast?" |
| **Technology choices** | "Prefer async/await or callbacks for this integration?" |
| **Priority decisions** | "Performance or simplicity - which matters more here?" |
| **Missing domain knowledge** | "How does the existing auth flow work in production?" |

**Key principles:**
- Present options, not open-ended questions when possible
- Include trade-offs for each option
- **Batch related questions together** - don't interrupt user flow
- Don't proceed with assumptions - ASK

## Extending Existing Plans

**When adding tasks to existing plan:**

1. Load existing plan: `Read(file_path="docs/plans/...")`
2. Parse structure (architecture, completed tasks, pending tasks)
3. Check git status for partially completed work
4. Verify new tasks are compatible with existing architecture
5. Check total: If original + new > 12 tasks, suggest splitting
6. Mark new tasks with `[NEW]` prefix
7. Update total count: `Total Tasks: X (Originally: Y)`
8. Add extension history: `> Extended [Date]: Tasks X-Y for [feature]`

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Migration/Refactoring Tasks

**When the task involves migrating, refactoring, or replacing existing code, you MUST complete these additional steps to prevent missing features.**

### Mandatory Feature Inventory (Phase 1.5)

**After exploration but BEFORE creating tasks:**

1. **List ALL files being replaced:**
   ```markdown
   ## Feature Inventory - Files Being Replaced

   | Old File | Functions/Classes | Status |
   |----------|-------------------|--------|
   | `old/module1.py` | `func_a()`, `func_b()`, `ClassX` | ⬜ Not mapped |
   | `old/module2.py` | `func_c()`, `func_d()` | ⬜ Not mapped |
   ```

2. **Map EVERY function/feature to a new task:**
   ```markdown
   ## Feature Mapping - Old → New

   | Old Feature | New Location | Task # |
   |-------------|--------------|--------|
   | `module1.func_a()` | `new/step1.py` | Task 3 |
   | `module1.func_b()` | `new/step1.py` | Task 3 |
   | `module2.func_c()` | `new/step2.py` | Task 5 |
   | `module2.func_d()` | ❌ MISSING | ⚠️ NEEDS TASK |
   ```

3. **Verify 100% coverage before proceeding:**
   - Every row must have a Task # or explicit "Out of Scope" justification
   - "Out of Scope" means the feature is INTENTIONALLY REMOVED (with user confirmation)
   - "Out of Scope" does NOT mean "migrate as-is" - that still needs a task!

### "Out of Scope" Clarification

**CRITICAL: "Out of Scope" has a precise meaning:**

| Phrase | Meaning | Requires Task? |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| "Out of Scope: Changes to X" | X will be migrated AS-IS, no modifications | ✅ YES - migration task |
| "Out of Scope: Feature X" | X is intentionally REMOVED/not included | ❌ NO - but needs user confirmation |
| "Out of Scope: New features for X" | X migrates as-is, no NEW features added | ✅ YES - migration task |

### Pre-Task Verification Gate

**Before finalizing tasks, verify:**

- [ ] All old files listed in Feature Inventory
- [ ] All functions/classes from old files identified
- [ ] Every feature mapped to a task OR explicitly marked "REMOVED" with user confirmation
- [ ] No row in Feature Mapping has "⬜ Not mapped" status
- [ ] User has confirmed any features marked for removal

**If any checkbox is unchecked, DO NOT proceed to implementation.**

---

## Creating New Plans

### Step 1.1: Create Plan File Header (FIRST)

**Immediately upon starting planning, create the plan file header for status bar detection.**

1. **Generate filename:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-slug>.md`
   - Use current date
   - Create slug from first 3-4 words of task description (lowercase, hyphens)
   - Example: "add user authentication" → `2026-01-24-add-user-authentication.md`

2. **Create directory if needed:** `mkdir -p docs/plans`

3. **Write initial header immediately:**
   ```markdown
   # [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

   Created: [Date]
   Status: PENDING
   Approved: No
   Iterations: 0

   > Planning in progress...

   ## Summary
   **Goal:** [Task description from user]

   ---
   *Exploring codebase and gathering requirements...*
   ```

4. **Register plan association (MANDATORY):**
   ```bash
   ~/.pilot/bin/pilot register-plan "<plan_path>" "PENDING" 2>/dev/null || true
   ```
   This tells the statusline which plan belongs to THIS session. Without it, parallel sessions show the wrong plan.

5. **Why this matters:**
   - Status bar shows "Spec: <name> [/plan]" immediately
   - User sees progress even during exploration phase
   - Plan file exists for continuation if session clears
   - Plan is correctly associated with this specific terminal

**CRITICAL:** Do this FIRST, before any exploration or questions.

---

### Step 1.2: Task Understanding & Clarification

**First, clearly state your understanding of the task.**

Before any exploration:
1. Restate what the user is asking for in your own words
2. Identify the core problem being solved
3. List any assumptions you're making

**Then gather clarifications if needed (Question Batch 1):**

If ambiguities exist, use AskUserQuestion to ask everything upfront in a single interaction. If the task is clear and unambiguous, skip directly to Step 1.3.

### Step 1.3: Exploration

**Explore the codebase systematically.** Run explorations **one at a time** (sequentially, not in parallel).

#### 🔧 Tools for Exploration

| Tool | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Context7** | Library/framework docs | `resolve-library-id(query="your question", libraryName="lib")` then `query-docs(libraryId, query)` |
| **Vexor** | Semantic code search | `vexor search "query" --mode code` |
| **grep-mcp** | Real-world GitHub examples | `searchGitHub(query="FastMCP", language=["Python"])` |
| **Read/Grep/Glob** | Direct file exploration | Use directly, no sub-agents |

**Exploration areas (in order):**

1. **Architecture** - Project structure, entry points, how components connect
2. **Similar Features** - Existing patterns that relate to the task, what can be reused
3. **Dependencies** - Imports, modules, what will be impacted
4. **Tests** - Test infrastructure, existing patterns, available fixtures

**For each area:**
- Document hypotheses (not conclusions)
- Note full file paths for relevant code
- Track questions that remain unanswered

**After explorations complete:**
1. Read each identified file to verify hypotheses
2. Build a complete mental model of current architecture
3. Identify integration points and potential risks
4. Note reusable patterns

### Step 1.4: Design Decisions

**Present findings and gather all design decisions (Question Batch 2).**

Summarize what you found, then use AskUserQuestion with all decisions at once.

**After user answers:**
- Incorporate their choices into the plan design
- Proceed to Step 1.5 — the user will review the full plan at Step 1.8

### Step 1.5: Implementation Planning

**Task Granularity**

Each task should be:
- **Independently testable** — has its own tests that pass without other tasks being complete
- **Focused** — touches 2-4 files max; more means it should be split
- **Verifiable** — produces an observable result (test output, API response, UI change)

Split a task if it has multiple unrelated DoD criteria. Merge tasks if one can't be tested without the other. Don't create tasks for setup/boilerplate that have no standalone value — fold them into the first task that uses them.

**Task Structure:**
```markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Objective:** [1-2 sentences describing what to build]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Key Decisions / Notes:**
- [Technical approach or algorithm to use]
- [Which existing pattern to follow, with file:line reference]
- [Integration points with other tasks or existing code]

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration if applicable)
- [ ] No diagnostics errors (linting, type checking)
- [ ] [Task-specific criterion with observable outcome]
- [ ] [Task-specific criterion with observable outcome]
```

**⚠️ DoD criteria must be verifiable.** The verification phase checks each criterion against the actual code and running program. Replace the `[Task-specific criterion]` placeholders with criteria that can be checked with a specific test, command, or observation.

✅ Good DoD examples:
- "GET /api/users?role=admin returns only admin users"
- "Form shows validation error when email field is empty"
- "CLI exits with code 1 and prints usage when no arguments given"
- "Retry logic attempts 3 times with exponential backoff before failing"

❌ Bad DoD (never use these):
- "Feature works correctly"
- "Edge cases handled appropriately"
- "Error messages are clear and actionable"

**Zero-context assumption:**
- Assume implementer knows nothing about codebase
- Provide exact file paths
- Explain domain concepts
- List integration points
- Reference similar patterns in codebase

### Step 1.6: Write Full Plan

**Save plan to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

**Required plan template:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

Created: [Date]
Status: PENDING
Approved: No
Iterations: 0

> **Status Lifecycle:** PENDING → COMPLETE → VERIFIED
> **Iterations:** Tracks implement→verify cycles (incremented by verify phase)
> - PENDING: Initial state, awaiting implementation
> - COMPLETE: All tasks implemented
> - VERIFIED: All checks passed
>
> **Approval Gate:** Implementation CANNOT proceed until `Approved: Yes`

## Summary
**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about chosen approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

## Scope

### In Scope
- [What WILL be changed/built]
- [Specific components affected]

### Out of Scope
- [What will NOT be changed]
- [Explicit boundaries]

## Prerequisites
- [Any requirements before starting]
- [Dependencies that must exist]
- [Environment setup needed]

## Context for Implementer

> This section is critical for cross-session continuity. Write it for an implementer who has never seen the codebase.

- **Patterns to follow:** [Reference existing file:line that demonstrates the pattern, e.g., "Follow the route handler pattern in `src/routes/users.ts:45`"]
- **Conventions:** [Naming, file organization, error handling approach used in this project]
- **Key files:** [Important files the implementer must read first, with brief description of each]
- **Gotchas:** [Non-obvious dependencies, quirks, things that look wrong but are intentional]
- **Domain context:** [Business logic or domain concepts needed to understand the task]

## Runtime Environment (if applicable)

> Include this section when the project has a running service, API, or UI.
> Delete if the project is a library or CLI tool with no long-running process.

- **Start command:** [How to start the service, e.g., `bun worker-service.cjs`]
- **Port:** [What port it listens on]
- **Deploy path:** [Where built artifacts are installed, if different from source]
- **Health check:** [How to verify the service is running, e.g., `curl http://localhost:PORT/health`]
- **Restart procedure:** [How to restart after code changes]

## Feature Inventory (FOR MIGRATION/REFACTORING ONLY)

> **Include this section when replacing existing code. Delete if not applicable.**

### Files Being Replaced

| Old File | Functions/Classes | Mapped to Task |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| `old/file1.py` | `func_a()`, `func_b()` | Task 3 |
| `old/file2.py` | `ClassX`, `func_c()` | Task 4, Task 5 |

### Feature Mapping Verification

- [ ] All old files listed above
- [ ] All functions/classes identified
- [ ] Every feature has a task number
- [ ] No features accidentally omitted

**⚠️ If any feature shows "❌ MISSING", add a task before implementation!**

## Progress Tracking

**MANDATORY: Update this checklist as tasks complete. Change `[ ]` to `[x]`.**

- [ ] Task 1: [Brief summary]
- [ ] Task 2: [Brief summary]
- [ ] ...

**Total Tasks:** [Number] | **Completed:** 0 | **Remaining:** [Number]

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: [Component Name]
[Full task structure]

### Task 2: [Component Name]
[Full task structure]

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: [What to test in isolation]
- Integration tests: [What to test together]
- Manual verification: [Steps to verify manually]

## Risks and Mitigations

> Consider: breaking changes, backward compatibility, data loss/migration, performance regression, security implications, state management complexity, cross-component coupling, external dependency failures.

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | [Concrete, implementable mitigation] |

**⚠️ Risk mitigations are commitments.** The verification phase (spec-verifier) will check that every mitigation listed here is actually implemented in code. Write mitigations as concrete, implementable behaviors, not vague statements.

✅ Good: "If selected project not in available list, reset to null (All Projects)"
❌ Bad: "Handle edge cases appropriately"

## Open Questions
- [Any remaining questions for the user]
- [Decisions deferred to implementation]
```

### Step 1.7: Plan Verification

**⛔ THIS STEP IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. You MUST run plan verification before asking for approval.**

Before presenting the plan to the user, verify it with a dedicated verifier agent. This catches missing requirements, scope issues, and misalignments BEFORE the user sees the plan.

#### Launch Plan Verification

Spawn 1 `plan-verifier` agent using the Task tool:

```
Task(
  subagent_type="pilot:plan-verifier",
  prompt="""
  **Plan file:** <plan-path>
  **User request:** <original task description from user>
  **Clarifications:** <any Q&A that clarified requirements>

  Verify this plan correctly captures the user's requirements.
  Check for missing features, scope issues, and ambiguities.
  """
)
```

The verifier:
- Reviews plan against original user request
- Checks if clarification answers are incorporated
- Identifies missing requirements or scope issues
- Returns structured JSON findings

#### Fix All Findings

After verification completes, fix all issues by severity:

| Severity | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **must_fix** | Fix immediately - update plan before proceeding |
| **should_fix** | Fix immediately - update plan before proceeding |
| **suggestion** | Incorporate if reasonable, or note in Open Questions |

**Only proceed to Step 1.8 after all must_fix and should_fix issues are resolved.**

### Step 1.8: Get User Approval

**⛔ MANDATORY APPROVAL GATE - This is NON-NEGOTIABLE**

**After saving plan:**

1. **Summarize the plan** - Provide a brief overview of:
   - What will be built (goal)
   - Key tasks (numbered list)
   - Tech stack / approach

2. **Use AskUserQuestion to request approval:**
   ```
   Question: "Do you approve this plan for implementation?"
   Header: "Plan Review"
   Options:
   - "Yes, proceed with implementation" - I've reviewed the plan and it looks good
   - "No, I need to make changes" - I want to edit the plan first
   ```

3. **Based on user response:**

   **If user selects "Yes, proceed with implementation":**
   - Edit the plan file to change `Approved: No` to `Approved: Yes`
   - **⛔ Phase Transition Context Guard:** Run `~/.pilot/bin/pilot check-context --json`. If >= 80%, hand off instead (see spec.md Section 0.3).
   - **Invoke implementation phase:** `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')`

   **If user selects "No, I need to make changes":**
   - Tell user: "Please edit the plan file at `<plan-path>`, then say 'ready' when done"
   - Wait for user to confirm they're done editing
   - Re-read the plan file to see their changes
   - Ask for approval again using AskUserQuestion

   **If user provides OTHER feedback (corrections, config values, clarifications):**
   - This is NOT approval - they're giving you changes to incorporate
   - Update the plan with their feedback
   - Ask for approval AGAIN with a fresh AskUserQuestion

4. **DO NOT proceed to implementation until user explicitly selects "Yes, proceed"**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Any response other than selecting "Yes, proceed with implementation" is NOT approval. Config feedback, threshold changes, clarifications = update plan, then re-ask.**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Claude handles the `Approved:` field update - user never edits it manually**

---

## Context Management (90% Handoff)

After each major operation, check context:

```bash
~/.pilot/bin/pilot check-context --json
```

**Between iterations:**
1. If context >= 90%: hand off cleanly (don't rush!)
2. If context 80-89%: continue but wrap up current task with quality
3. If context < 80%: continue the loop freely

If response shows `"status": "CLEAR_NEEDED"` (context >= 90%):

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Execute ALL steps below in a SINGLE turn. DO NOT stop or wait for user response between steps.**

**Step 1: Write continuation file (GUARANTEED BACKUP)**

Write to `~/.pilot/sessions/$PILOT_SESSION_ID/continuation.md`:

```markdown
# Session Continuation (/spec)

**Plan:** <plan-path>
**Phase:** planning
**Current Task:** [description of where you are in planning]

**Completed This Session:**
- [x] [What was finished]

**Next Steps:**
1. [What to do immediately when resuming]

**Context:**
- [Key decisions or blockers]
```

**Step 2: Trigger session clear**

```bash
~/.pilot/bin/pilot send-clear <plan-path>
```

Pilot will restart with `/spec --continue <plan-path>`
