# /spec - Unified Spec-Driven Development

**For new features, major changes, and complex work.** Creates a spec, gets your approval, implements with TDD, and verifies completion - all in one continuous flow.

This command is a **dispatcher** that determines which phase to run and invokes it via `Skill()`.

---

## 📋 WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

```
/spec → Dispatcher → Skill('spec-plan')    → Plan, verify, approve
                   → Skill('spec-implement') → TDD loop for each task
                   → Skill('spec-verify')    → Tests, execution, code review
```

| Phase | Skill | What Happens |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Planning** | `spec-plan` | Explore → Design → Write plan → Verify → Approve |
| **Implementation** | `spec-implement` | TDD loop for each task |
| **Verification** | `spec-verify` | Tests → Execution → Rules → Code Review → E2E |

### Status-Based Flow

```
PENDING (Not Approved) → spec-plan    → User approves
PENDING (Approved)     → spec-implement → All tasks done → COMPLETE
COMPLETE               → spec-verify   → All checks pass → VERIFIED
VERIFIED               → Done!
```

### The Feedback Loop

```
spec-verify finds issues → Status: PENDING → spec-implement fixes → COMPLETE → spec-verify → ... → VERIFIED
```

## 0.1 Parse Arguments

```
/spec <task-description>           # Start new workflow from task
/spec <path/to/plan.md>            # Continue existing plan
/spec --continue <path/to/plan.md> # Resume after session clear
```

Parse the arguments: $ARGUMENTS

### Determine Current State

```
IF arguments start with "--continue":
    plan_path = extract path after "--continue"
    1. Read ~/.pilot/sessions/$PILOT_SESSION_ID/continuation.md if it exists
    2. Delete the continuation file after reading
    3. Read plan file, check Status AND Approved fields
    → Dispatch to appropriate phase based on status

ELIF arguments end with ".md" AND file exists:
    plan_path = arguments
    → Read plan file, check Status AND Approved fields
    → Dispatch to appropriate phase based on status

ELSE:
    task_description = arguments
    → Invoke planning phase: Skill(skill='spec-plan', args='<task_description>')
```

**After reading the plan file, register the plan association (non-blocking):**

```bash
~/.pilot/bin/pilot register-plan "<plan_path>" "<status>" 2>/dev/null || true
```

This tells Console which session is working on which plan. Failure is silently ignored.

## 0.2 Status-Based Dispatch

Read the plan file and dispatch based on Status and Approved fields:

| Status | Approved | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| PENDING | No | `Skill(skill='spec-plan', args='<plan-path>')` |
| PENDING | Yes | `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')` |
| COMPLETE | * | `Skill(skill='spec-verify', args='<plan-path>')` |
| VERIFIED | * | Report completion, workflow done |

**⛔ Phase Transition Context Guard applies before every dispatch (see Section 0.3).**

**Invoke the appropriate Skill immediately. Do not duplicate phase logic here.**

### Report Completion (VERIFIED)

If the plan status is already VERIFIED:

```
✅ Workflow complete! Plan status: VERIFIED

The plan at <plan-path> has been fully implemented and verified.
Is there anything else you'd like me to help with?
```

## 0.3 Phase Transition Context Guard

**⛔ MANDATORY: Before EVERY `Skill()` call that transitions to another phase, check context:**

```bash
~/.pilot/bin/pilot check-context --json
```

| Percentage | Action |
|------------|--------|
| **< 80%** | Proceed with phase transition |
| **>= 80%** | **Do NOT invoke the next phase.** Hand off instead. |

Each phase (plan, implement, verify) needs significant context to complete. Starting a new phase above 80% risks overshooting to 100% — the worst-case scenario where all work is lost.

**When >= 80%:** Write continuation file, trigger `send-clear`. The next session dispatches to the correct phase automatically based on plan status.

**This applies to ALL transitions:** plan→implement, implement→verify, verify→implement (feedback loop), and dispatcher→any phase.

---

## 0.4 Context Management (90% Handoff)

After each major operation, check context:

```bash
~/.pilot/bin/pilot check-context --json
```

**Between iterations:**
1. If context >= 90%: hand off cleanly (don't rush!)
2. If context 80-89%: continue but wrap up current task with quality
3. If context < 80%: continue the loop freely

If response shows `"status": "CLEAR_NEEDED"` (context >= 90%):

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Execute ALL steps below in a SINGLE turn. DO NOT stop or wait for user response between steps.**

**Step 1: Write continuation file (GUARANTEED BACKUP)**

Write to `~/.pilot/sessions/$PILOT_SESSION_ID/continuation.md`:

```markdown
# Session Continuation (/spec)

**Plan:** <plan-path>
**Phase:** [planning|implementation|verification]
**Current Task:** Task N - [description]

**Completed This Session:**
- [x] [What was finished]

**Next Steps:**
1. [What to do immediately when resuming]

**Context:**
- [Key decisions or blockers]
```

**Step 2: Trigger session clear**

```bash
~/.pilot/bin/pilot send-clear <plan-path>
```

Pilot will restart with `/spec --continue <plan-path>`

### Error Handling

**No Active Session:** If `send-clear` fails, tell user: "Context at X%. Please run `/clear` manually, then `/spec --continue <plan-path>`"

**Plan File Not Found:** Tell user: "Plan file not found: <path>" and ask if they want to create a new plan.

## 0.5 Rules Summary (Quick Reference)

| # | Rule |
|---|------|
| 1 | **NO sub-agents during planning/implementation** - Phase 1 and 2 use direct tools only. Verification steps (Step 1.7, Step 3.5) each use a single verifier sub-agent. |
| 2 | **NEVER SKIP verification** - Plan verification (Step 1.7) and Code verification (Step 3.5) are mandatory. No exceptions. |
| 3 | **ONLY stopping point is plan approval** - Everything else is automatic. Never ask "Should I fix these?" |
| 4 | **Batch questions together** - Don't interrupt user flow |
| 5 | **Run explorations sequentially** - One at a time, never in parallel |
| 6 | **NEVER write code during planning** - Separate phases |
| 7 | **NEVER assume - verify by reading files** |
| 8 | **Re-read plan after user edits** - Before asking for approval again |
| 9 | **TDD is MANDATORY** - No production code without failing test first |
| 10 | **Update plan checkboxes after EACH task** - Not at the end |
| 11 | **Quality over speed** - Never rush due to context pressure. But at 90%+ context, handoff overrides everything - do NOT start new fix cycles |
| 12 | **Plan file is source of truth** - Survives session clears |
| 13 | **Phase Transition Context Guard** - Check context before EVERY phase transition. If >= 80%, hand off instead of starting next phase (Section 0.3) |
