    question: "Does Pilot send my code or data to external services?",
    answer:
      "No code, files, prompts, project data, or personal information ever leaves your machine through Pilot. All development tools \u2014 vector search, persistent memory, session state, and quality hooks \u2014 run entirely locally. Pilot makes external calls only for licensing: (1) License validation \u2014 once every 24 hours, your license key is checked against Polar\u2019s API (api.polar.sh). (2) License activation \u2014 one-time, sends license key, machine fingerprint, OS, and architecture to api.polar.sh, plus a one-time activation analytics event (tier, Pilot version, OS info) to claude-pilot.com. (3) Trial \u2014 sends a hashed hardware fingerprint, OS, and Pilot version to claude-pilot.com to generate a 7-day trial key, with a lightweight heartbeat on each session start during the trial. That\u2019s the complete list. No code, no filenames, no prompts, no project content. The validation result is cached locally, and Pilot works fully offline for up to 7 days.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Pilot enterprise-compliant for data privacy?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Your source code, project files, and development context never leave your machine through Pilot. The only external calls Pilot makes are for license management \u2014 validation (daily to api.polar.sh), activation and analytics (one-time), and trial heartbeats. None of these transmit any code, project data, or personal information. Enterprises using Claude Code with their own API key or Anthropic Enterprise subscription can add Pilot without changing their data compliance posture.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the licenses of Pilot's dependencies?",
    answer:
      "All external tools and dependencies that Pilot installs and uses are open source with permissive licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD). This includes ruff, basedpyright, Prettier, ESLint, gofmt, uv, Vexor, playwright-cli, and all MCP servers. No copyleft or restrictive-licensed dependencies are introduced into your environment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a separate Anthropic subscription?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Pilot enhances Claude Code \u2014 it doesn't replace it. You need an active Claude subscription (Max, Team, or Enterprise) or an Anthropic API key. Pilot adds quality automation on top of whatever Claude Code access you already have.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Pilot work with any programming language?",
    answer:
      "Pilot's quality hooks (auto-formatting, linting, type checking) currently support Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Go out of the box. TDD enforcement, spec-driven development, Endless Mode, persistent memory, and all rules and standards work with any language that Claude Code supports. You can add custom hooks for additional languages.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Pilot on multiple projects?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Pilot installs once and works across all your projects. Each project can have its own rules, standards, and MCP servers in the .claude/ folder. Run /sync in each project to generate project-specific documentation and standards.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize the rules and hooks?",
    answer:
      "Yes. All rules are markdown files you can edit, extend, or replace. Hooks are Python scripts you can modify. Built-in coding standards are conditional rules that activate by file type and can be customized. You can also create custom skills via /learn. Project-specific rules override global defaults. Use /vault to share customizations across your team.",
